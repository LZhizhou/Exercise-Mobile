## Tasks üìù

In our business, we have shifts and a set of professionals assigned to each shift. You are tasked with building a mobile application using Flutter that displays two screens: **Shifts** and **Shift Details**.

To fetch data use [/shifts/](https://099f998e-8348-4d04-83b6-891462df8f52.mock.pstmn.io/shifts) endpoint (https://099f998e-8348-4d04-83b6-891462df8f52.mock.pstmn.io/shifts).
API docs for the endpoint is available [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/18371161/UVJfhuPi).

The Shifts screen should display a list of all available shifts, grouped by date:

Clicking on any Shift will open the ShiftDetails screen where Professionals assigned to that Shift and Shift Details are displayed.

Try to follow the designs as closely as possible. Please make sure to handle edge cases.
